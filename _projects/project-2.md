This project investigated how modifying the temperature-dependent terms in the Stochastic Gross-Pitaevskii Equation (SPGPE) might allow Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) to persist at temperatures above the conventional upper limit of roughly 0.8 Tc. 
By introducing adaptive scaling of the energy- and number-damping coefficients, we explored a range of scenarios up to about 1.2 Tc.

# Key Outcomes and Insights

---

## Enhanced Coefficient Framework
- Proposed a temperature-driven multiplier function, **α(T)**, applied to the energy-damping rate.  
- Explored dynamic cutoffs **εcut(T)** to keep the coherent region well defined at higher T.  

---

## Numerical Exploration
- Implemented the modified SPGPE in a spectral-Galerkin solver with semi-implicit timestepping.  
- Tested condensate fraction, phase coherence, and vortex/soliton stability across **T = 0.6 Tc – 1.2 Tc**.  

---

## Observed Trends
- **Condensate Fraction:** gradually declined but remained nonzero up to ~1.1 Tc.  
- **Phase Coherence:** persisted longer than naïve extrapolation would predict.  
- **Topological Structures:** vortices and solitons remained dynamically active under enhanced damping.  

---

## Potential Applications
- **Room-Temperature Atom Interferometry:** even modest condensate fractions above 0.8 Tc could improve sensor robustness.  
- **Compact Quantum Devices:** reduced cryogenic demands may simplify portable quantum clocks and magnetometers.  
- **Fundamental Studies:** provides a platform to probe superfluid transitions and vortex dynamics in a high-T regime.

## Future Directions

### Parameter Optimization
- Use automated searches (e.g., genetic algorithms) to refine **α(T)** and **εcut(T)** for specific trap geometries.  

### Beyond Mean-Field Effects
- Incorporate beyond-Gross-Pitaevskii corrections (e.g., **Lee-Huang-Yang terms**) to examine limits of the classical-field approach.  

### Experimental Collaboration
- Partner with cold-atom labs to test theoretical predictions near **T ≈ Tc** in real traps, focusing on observables like condensate fraction and vortex lifetimes.

## Summary
This exploratory work highlights promising avenues for extending **BEC research into warmer regimes**, offering new possibilities for **fundamental physics** and **emerging quantum technologies**.
