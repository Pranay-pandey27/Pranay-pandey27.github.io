## Characterising Circuitry for Evaporative Cooling | Research Intern  

**Role & Supervision**  
- Research Intern under *Prof. Saptarishi Chaudhuri*, Raman Research Institute (May ’23)  

**Aim**  
- Design and optimise RF circuitry to implement evaporative cooling for K-39/Na-23 Bose–Bose mixtures  
- Achieve efficient removal of high-energy atoms to approach quantum degeneracy and Bose–Einstein Condensation (BEC)  

**Circuit Design**  
- Developed two tunable LCR networks covering **28–55 MHz** and **45–105 MHz** using varactor diodes (20–110 pF) and custom copper coils  
- Achieved **50 Ω impedance matching** and employed RF shielding to minimise electronic noise  
- Implemented SPDT switching for seamless range selection between frequency bands  

**Evaporative Cooling Implementation**  
- Applied frequency-swept RF radiation to drive **trapped → anti-trapped Landau–Zener transitions**  
- Selectively expelled high-energy atoms to reduce ensemble temperature  

**Optimization & Results**  
- Automated mapping of RF frequency to varactor bias via custom power-supply control code  
- Optimised RF sweep trajectory (frequency ramp + power profile) to maximise cooling efficiency  
- Demonstrated consistent reduction of thermal tail and approach toward **BEC phase-space density**
