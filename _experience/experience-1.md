## 1. Precise Measurements and Advanced Modelling of Barium Ion Polarizability  
**Master's Thesis Project**

### Research Aim & Objective
- Experimentally measure the differential polarizability zero crossing in the Ba⁺ ion clock transition at 480 nm  
- Develop advanced laser stabilisation techniques using Pound–Drever–Hall (PDH)  
- Theoretically model polarizability with perturbation theory, incorporating branching ratios and matrix elements  
- Minimise Stark shifts and improve optical clock performance  

### Problem Statement & Motivation
- Electric field-induced Stark shifts degrade optical clock precision  
- Ba⁺ ions exhibit a unique differential polarizability zero crossing at 480 nm that eliminates frequency errors  
- Need for next-generation atomic clocks with enhanced precision for navigation, communication, and fundamental physics  

### Theoretical Framework
- Differential polarizability model using quantum mechanics and perturbation theory  
- Relativistic Hartree–Fock and Brueckner orbitals for many-body corrections  
- Linearised coupled-cluster method for accuracy  
- Analysis of third-order hyperfine interactions and AC Stark shifts  
- Identification of magic wavelengths for optimal clock operation  

### Experimental Methodology
- **Laser System:** External Cavity Diode Laser (ECDL), narrow linewidth  
- **Power Amplification:** Tapered Amplifier with high gain  
- **Frequency Doubling:** PPKTP crystal (960 nm → 480 nm, 45–50% efficiency)  
- **Stabilisation:** Triple optical isolation, PDH locking  
- **Control Systems:** Acousto-Optic Modulator with precise beam switching  

### Key Technical Achievements
- Built complete experimental apparatus with quantum-level stability  
- Achieved 45–50% frequency doubling efficiency  
- Implemented robust stabilisation (44 dB optical isolation)  
- Automated PID-controlled systems for temperature and high-voltage drivers  
- Validated theoretical model against atomic structure calculations  

### Expected Results & Impact
- **Immediate:** Accurate determination of Ba⁺ polarizability zero crossing  
- **Scientific:** Refinement of theoretical parameters  
- **Technological:** Stark shift minimisation → better atomic clocks  
- **Applications:** GPS, secure communications, fundamental physics  

### Challenges & Solutions
- Overcame lack of 960 nm isolators by combining 780 nm + adjustable isolators  
- Added multiple stabilisation layers for vibration/temperature control  
- Integrated complex multi-stage laser system successfully  

### Future Implications
- Basis for next-gen Ba⁺-based optical frequency standards  
- Contributions to quantum metrology and precision measurements  
- Applications in quantum computing and fundamental research

## 2. Designing Compact Thermal and Pressure-Stabilised Cavity for Portable Atomic Clocks  
**Research Intern under Prof. Douglas Murray Barrett, National University of Singapore (May ’24)**

### Aim & Objectives
- Develop a passively stable optical reference cavity for portable atomic clocks  
- Design miniature Fabry–Pérot cavity with temperature and pressure stabilisation  
- Implement dual-laser locking scheme for monitoring drift  

### Theoretical Background
- Resonance: *f = c / (2nL)*  
- Frequency shifts arise from ∂n/∂T, ∂n/∂p, and expansion coefficient α  
- Derived fractional frequency shift equations for T and p dependence  

### Experimental Setup
- Test cavities: Zerodur (3 cm), Quartz (10 cm, 1.5 cm)  
- Monitored with Cs-referenced 852 nm laser  
- Temperature control: PID + TECs  
- Pressure control: vacuum chamber + sealed enclosure  

### Procedure & Measurements
- Tracked free-spectral-range drift  
- Correlated fluctuations with temperature  
- Sealed cavity to suppress pressure-induced shifts  
- Observed long-term drift (~200 MHz/day) due to epoxy ageing and quartz creep  

### Key Findings
- Unstabilised cavities drifted 8–17 MHz/day  
- Measured α much higher than theoretical due to epoxy  
- Pressure sealing removed rapid drifts  
- Dual-laser locking allowed post-correction  

### Conclusions & Future Work
- Combined thermal & pressure stabilisation yields compact robust cavity  
- Future: low-α adhesives, extended monitoring, active pressure control

- Varactor diodes (20–110 pF) and custom copper coils  
- 50 Ω impedance matching, RF shielding, SPDT switching  

### Implementation
- Applied frequency-swept RF radiation for Landau–Zener transitions  
- Selectively removed hot atoms → reduced ensemble temperature  

### Optimisation & Results
