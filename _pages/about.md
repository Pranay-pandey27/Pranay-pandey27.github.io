Hi, I’m Pranay Pandey—a curious mind on a journey through the fascinating world of quantum physics and technology. From my student days at IIT Kharagpur to hands-on research in quantum computing, machine learning, and optics, science has been my way of exploring the unknown and finding creative solutions to real-world problems.

Along the way, I’ve had the chance to work with some amazing teams—be it developing quantum algorithms for smarter predictions, tinkering in the lab with lasers and ions, or leading spirited groups at campus events. I genuinely enjoy blending big-picture thinking with technical details, whether I’m coding, building models, or mentoring peers. Python and MATLAB are my go-to tools, and I thrive equally in front of whiteboards and workbenches.

What keeps me motivated is the excitement of learning something new and the hope that my curiosity can eventually help make a difference, whether that’s in science, technology, or the communities I’m part of. Beyond the lab, you’ll often find me organising events, exploring new ideas with friends, or unwinding with a good book.

Thanks for stopping by and sharing a bit of my journey. Let’s connect and see where discovery takes us next!
